# RedditBot
A Discord bot used to show Reddit posts

RedditBot is a Discord bot meant to help you browse Reddit posts from Discord! To get started, use r/{subreddit} to search for a post. Once RedditBot sends a post, there will be 2 additional reactions, one will skip the post onto another random post and the other will delete the post.
